/**
 * \brief A class to wrap all the communication done with the help of ZeroMQ and Msgpack 
 *	ZeroMq is a networking protocol whilst msgpack an encoding format used by the client from Pupil Service for maximum communication speed. You can think of msgpack as a JSON format but send in binary Instead of Human Readeble Format
 *	Also Other Strucs and values can be accessed from the this Helper class like :
 *	gaze
 *	notify
 *	pupil
 *	logging
 *	By changing the Topic filter (Upcomming feature)
